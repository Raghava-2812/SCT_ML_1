# 🏡 SCT_ML_1 – House Price Prediction

## 📌 Objective
Predict house prices based on features like the number of bedrooms and bathrooms using **Linear Regression**.

## 🧠 Skills Applied
- Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas & Seaborn
- Linear Regression Model Building using Scikit-learn
- Evaluation Metrics (R² score, Mean Absolute Error, RMSE)

## 🗂️ Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Square footage
- Location (optional)
- Price (target variable)

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Results
Achieved a good fit on the dataset with a reasonable error margin. The model shows that features like number of bathrooms and square footage have a significant impact on price.
